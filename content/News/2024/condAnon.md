We are pleased to announce the publication of our paper *Measuring Conditional Anonymity - A Global Study* at PETS'24.

Our research examines the real-world effectiveness of pseudonymization in health applications, focusing on two major applications in 39 countries. Key findings show that users of a popular menstruation tracking app can be de-anonymized to groups of as few as five people in 97% of U.S. counties - posing a serious privacy risk, especially in light of recent legal changes regarding abortion rights.

Stay tuned for more insights from our PETS'24 presentation!
