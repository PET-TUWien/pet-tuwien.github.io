We are pleased to announce our latest publication, *"SoK: Descriptive Statistics Under Local Differential Privacy"*, which will be presented at PETS'25. This work provides a comprehensive survey and systematization of existing techniques for performing descriptive statistical analysis while preserving privacy under Local Differential Privacy (LDP).

Our study delves into the strengths and limitations of various LDP methods, providing insights into their practical applications and future research directions. We believe this work will be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to balance data utility and privacy in statistical analysis.

Stay tuned for more details and discussions on this topic at PETS'25!
