The project is a practical class in which the students implement and evaluate concepts and methods in privacy and cryptography. As an example consider the ongoing project VisualAnon. This project follows our research about the anonymity of fitness apps that showed at the example of Germany how considerably the anonymity decreases by the leakage of socio-democratic data. The goal of VisualAnon is to cause awareness about the anonymity set people live in, not only for Germany but for arbitrary countries
