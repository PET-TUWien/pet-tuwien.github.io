The ideal starting point to deepening the studies in the area of privacy and cryptography is the winter term,
in which I offer an introductory lecture to modern cryptography. Students may continue their studies with data
privacy
I and/or cryptocurrencies I in the summer term and attend the second part of each lecture in the winter term.
If a student wishes to start in the summer term, then beginning with cryptocurrencies I or data privacy I is
possible.
Both lectures only require some basics in cryptography, which will be introduced in the first lecture. Then, in
the
winter term, the students can take the classes introduction to modern cryptography and data privacy
II/cryptocurrencies II in parallel.
