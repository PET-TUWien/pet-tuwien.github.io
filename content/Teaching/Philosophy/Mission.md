ChaAC focuses on developing and analysing cryptographic techniques, schemes, and protocols that help to address a variety of IT security and privacy problems. In particular,  
- we investigate the hardness to realize certain cryptographic mechanisms
- we study the relationship between different cryptographic primitives
- we develop cryptographic techniques to protect the privacy of the people
- we build cryptographic schemes to verifiably outsource the computation and storage to the cloud
- we design efficient cryptographic schemes to harden passwords and encrypted structured data 
- we analyse the security of cryptographic schemes and protocol used in practice
- we study cryptocurrencies, such e.g., Bitcoin and Monero
