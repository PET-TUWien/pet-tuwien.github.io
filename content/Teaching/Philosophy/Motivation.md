My teaching philosophy is based on the following two facts, that distinguish the possibilities of teaching today from only a few decades ago:

##### Information is easy to access and provided by many different institutions #####

For example, consider the groundbreaking RSA encryption scheme that I teach in my introductory class to modern cryptography. This first public-key encryption scheme is used by any device when accessing emails or websites securely. Only a few decades ago, my lecture would have been the only source for students to learn about the breathtaking invention. Today, the students may listen to my lecture or watch Ron Rivest’02 ACM Turing Award Lecture, where he tells the history behind the invention of the RSA encryption scheme, freely accessible on youtube. Thus, whenever a student wishes to learn a particular subject, many videos, lectures notes, and original research papers are online available.

##### Technological advances #####

Nowadays, we can use many different technologies to support individual learning. Starting with classic methods such as books, lecture notes, exercise sheets, (board) presentations, accompanying videos, and introductory podcasts. In the future, we will use AI methods to generate dedicated exercises based on the personal knowledge and progress of the student.

These two points raise the following fundamental question: What is the benefit for a student to attend my lecture? The answer to this question goes back to Einstein’s vision of teaching: “Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of minds to think”. With the ready availability of knowledge and advances in technology, Einstein’s words carry even more weight today than they did then. My lectures support student learning by giving them a well-structured approach to a topic and practicing independent learning through a process that I will explain in the following.
