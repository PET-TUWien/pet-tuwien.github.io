My classes combine three elements, beginning with a self-study period, followed by guided learning, and ending with an independent learning phase:

##### Self-study, accessibility, and structure #####

In the self-study phase, the students obtain a work plan for each week together with written lecture material that lists the required prerequisites of each unit (such that the students may potentially repeat them), precise goals, and an outline of how the topic fits in the class. The material consists of written lectures notes, introductory podcasts, and accompanying teaching videos. This material completely replaces the regular (board) presentation and I assume that the student studied everything and prepared open questions before the guided learning class.

##### Guided learning #####

I call the first in-person meeting the guided learning phase, and it consists of two parts. In the first part, open questions from the self-study phase are discussed, followed by a specific problem, which is worked on together. This task is structured so that the knowledge learned from the first phase is first deepened and then slightly expanded. In addition, approaches to solving the problem are discussed together, and I then explain to the students how I approach the problem. The main idea of this part is to encourage (self)-thinking.

##### Independent learning #####

The last part is comparable to a classical exercise session. The students receive a weekly exercise sheet with three different problem types. The first one deepens the knowledge gained from the first two parts. The second problem set is slightly advanced and requires transferring a given approach to a new setting. The last problem set is extremely challenging and can only be solved by developing novel techniques. This problem set is marked and targeted for future Ph.D. students. After one week, the students present and discuss the solutions with their fellow students in class.
